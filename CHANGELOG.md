# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(pre-1.0, so minor versions may include breaking changes).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CI workflow now auto-creates a GitHub release on version tag push.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `POST /v1/chat/completions`, proxied verbatim to
  `OPENAI_UPSTREAM_URL`. Shares pool/bulkhead admission machinery with the
  existing Anthropic route, so a single pool can serve models from either
  provider.
- Incremental SSE usage extraction for OpenAI streams (`src/sse-openai.ts`),
  reading cumulative `usage` from the final `chat.completion.chunk` when the
  client sets `stream_options: { include_usage: true }`.
- `openaiUpstreamUrl` gateway option — both `upstreamUrl` and
  `openaiUpstreamUrl` are optional, allowing Anthropic-only, OpenAI-only, or
  combined deployments. A route with no configured upstream returns `404`.

### Changed

- Project renamed from its initial scaffold name to **torii-gateway**.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Initial scaffold: admission-first AI gateway built on
  [`async-bulkhead-llm@3.2.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-bulkhead-llm).
- `POST /v1/messages` admission-gated proxy to an Anthropic-shaped upstream,
  forwarding auth headers (`x-api-key`, `authorization`, `anthropic-version`,
  `anthropic-beta`) verbatim. The gateway holds no provider keys.
- Fail-fast token-budget admission control: every request reserves its
  estimated input + `max_tokens` before running, refunds the surplus as real
  usage arrives (including mid-stream), and rejects immediately once the
  ceiling is hit.
- Mid-stream usage reporting via incremental SSE parsing (`src/sse.ts`),
  reading Anthropic `message_start` / `message_delta` events to correct a
  long-running stream's budget hold live.
- Model-prefix routing across pools (longest-prefix match), with per-pool
  concurrency limits and an optional high-priority reserve tier via the
  `x-priority: high` request header.
- `GET /stats` for per-pool live stats (budget, slots, refunds) and
  `GET /healthz` for liveness.
- `429` / `503` / `504` rejection responses with an `x-admission-reason`
  header and a JSON `detail` capacity snapshot — no fabricated `Retry-After`.
- End-to-end test suite (`test/gateway.test.ts`) against mock upstreams.

### Fixed

- Test/build configuration: excluded `dist` from the test glob and scoped the
  build output to `src` only.
